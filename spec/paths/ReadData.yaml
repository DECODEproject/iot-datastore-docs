    Endpoint which allows a caller to read encrypted events from the datastore.
    Events are encrypted using a tool called Zenroom (https://zenroom.dyne.org),
    also developed as part of DECODE, meaning that only an entity with the
    correct private key will be able to decrypt any data read from the
    datastore.
